# Simple-Sticky-Notes
A simple sticky notes app i made for the web bc why not. (Also use of code is absolutely free, idc what you do with it)

## Installing NPM + React version (Assumed npm already installed)
To install the npm project just download the root folder of ```npm-react``` and cd into it.
Then just type ```npm install``` then start it: ```npm run dev```

I haven't tested building for react and npm so far.
Probably works tho.

Try it live at ```codecache.org/sticky-notes/``` (Not working yet btw)
