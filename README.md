# Simple-Sticky-Notes
A simple sticky notes app i made for the web bc why not. (Also use of code is absolutely free, idc what you do with it)

Pls create folder called assets and add all the png/jpg files into it, thanks.

Try it live at ```codecache.org/sticky-notes/``` (This i have to add in nginx for now).
